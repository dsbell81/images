This repo contains example packer config files for vanilla Windows 2012R2, CentOS 7, and Rocky 9 VirtualBox machines to show how vm build automation can work.

Scripts use clear text, hard coded username/password (packer/packer) for the sake of demonstration.

To use these files you will need to have the following set up on your machine:
  - VirtualBox
  - Packer
  - For Windows
    1. Windows 2012 R2 iso (see Windows json for specifics)
  - For CentOS
    1. CentOS 7 iso (see CentOS json for specifics)
  - For Rocky
    1. Rocky 9 iso (see Rocky json for specifics)
